# My-summer-in-markdown

# Introduction
## Shivam Bishunath, 10th grade, I love basketball.
# Goals for the School Year: 
## Some goals I have for this school year would be to make sure I get all A's. I would also like to make sure I get at least 3's and 4's on my AP tests. These goals are important to me because I would like to get into a good college.
# Favorite Summer Food: 
## My favorite summer food would be wings. I ate a lot of different types of wings by my favorite would be barbecued wings. Although they are messy, I personally like eating them and they taste good to me.

# Most Memorable Experiences
## My cousin got married this summer so it was very exciting and memorable to see her get married. Additionally, I met a lot of family that I've never seen before. Her marriage was also very memorable to me because it was the first wedding that I've been to.
# Summer Playlist: 
## I listened to a lot of Future, Yeat, and Lil Baby over the summer. My favorite song would be Solo from Future. I like Solo because its more of a melody and it helps me focus while practicing.

# Favorite Summer Memory with Friends: 
## My favorite memory with my friends would be when we were practicing at the park. We were running a lot of pickup basketball and I enjoyed it. Additionally, this helped me hone in on what skills I need to practice on.
